A good friend of mine has been mentoring me in the DeFi, NFT, and overall crypto space and it’s been amazing to see all the use-cases Ethereum can fill.</p>\n<p>I finally dipped my toe in the NFT waters with my first purchase of <a href=\"https://opensea.io/activity/secretsocietyofwhales\">Secret Society of Whales</a>. I chose SSoW because of their dedication to giving back to the community (so far the team has donated $50,000 to various mental health and environmental charities) and the membership perks such as random NFT raffles for all whales.</p>\n<p>You can see my NFT on OpenSea <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/0x88091012eedf8dba59d08e27ed7b22008f5d6fe5/4866?ref=0x2d2193f337a4e446c14caa5c90e7b5849203acd0&#x26;__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_GB8dElO7y7iSRfgAXz__bg6.QcasOXnpzX0nvaAHiqE-1630341704-0-gqNtZGzNAlCjcnBszQsl\">here</a>.
