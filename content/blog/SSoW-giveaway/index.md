title: The NFT Community Needs To Be Humble

Last night the NFT project I am a part of [Secret Society of Whales](https://opensea.io/activity/secretsocietyofwhales) had a giveaway raffle hosted on Twitch by [Kenny Brown](https://www.twitch.tv/kennybrown). There were a number of NFTs raffled off with a total value of over $300,000 which is amazing to me that such a new project can pull this off. 

What stuck with me though is the criticism that some of the community gave to Kenny for not completely understanding the NFT space. To me this is a hint to how many of the NFT holders don't understand how to build momentum when growing a startup. 

I work for a software company and we often hire these motivational speaker-type people to host some of our corporate events because they are energetic and great public speakers. We don't care that they have no idea how our software works because their job is to be charismatic and build hype, which is what Kenny did very well last night.

Additionally, I think it takes some self-awareness to be humble and realize members of NFT projects need to attract people that may not be experts in this space yet. Hint: do you think Steph Curry knew the in's and out's of Ethereum before he purchased his [Bored Ape](https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/stephen-curry-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-55-ethereum-purchase)? 

I see this pattern frequently in tech and it frustrates me because the goal is to make a product that everyone can adopt without knowing the intricate details. The crypto/NFT space prides itself in being a niche group but it's counterintuitive to the goal of wide adoption of crypto & NFTs. I think Kenny did a great job, I am happy to see him promoting SSoW, and I hope you will follow him on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kennybrown).
